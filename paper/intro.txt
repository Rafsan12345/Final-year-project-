Is the world heading towards the fourth industrial revolution.This is my project in continuation of that.I have tried to include in my project several of the factors that are playing an important role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.My project is IUT based Smart Switching Module
By this the analog switching method is changed and converted to ID.It enables switching from anywhere in the world.And also connected voltage divorce key temperature sensor and gas sensor.With the help, it is possible to determine the temperature and humidity and the amount of methane gas present in a specific place from anywhere in the world.I think if this is implemented properly, our sentiment tasks will become much easier.
I hope that my technology will work very well in the updated technologies of electrical engineering in the modern world.I have again arranged to save all the data of the project on the server on the same date so that it is convenient to do the based tasks later.
And I have also set up a mail system to send warning messages in different situations.The biggest advantage of my project is that it can be controlled with a system without changing the code to control it.
I hope that my ideas from this project will contribute to the development of updated electrical technology in the near future.Above all I would like to thank my supervisors and all my associates for their efforts and their cooperation which facilitated the completion of my technology.
