An important component of this project is computer vision, which enables visual inspection of controlled locations from remote locations.
With the help of this jute, it is basically possible to show the visualization of the controlled place from a very remote place or watch it in the form of video or CCTV footage.
If desired, it can be used for objectification or human detection related or various types of controlling related to computer subjects.
For the time being, I cut my mobile phone and used it as a webcam to facilitate the project showing and tried to stream all the data of the visualization through the internet i.e. through an IP link based set.
It uses Python as the programming language and Computer Vision as the library file and media from Computer Vision.
In this project it will basically detect the motion of any type of object and can detect the movement.
Along with the whole thing is to see from a far away place.
I used it as an app called IP Webcam and IPL Invest as a browser.
Where there is facility of recording and facility of viewing through internet.
