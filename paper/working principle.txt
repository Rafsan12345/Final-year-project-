The project is mainly based on Internet of Things.I have tried to use all the currently updated technologies of IT.
Five lamps are kept here as load.Four lamps are connected to the switching module and one lamp is connected to the voltage plane.
Used dth11 sensor as temperature sensor and methane gas sensor as gas sensor.
And used acs712 module as voltage dimmer.
Used adafruit.io website server as virtual control platform.
I used a web server called IFTTT for controlling.
And used four relay modules.
Used tv remote control system for manual control. 
I have arranged to control the technology through remote control while being very close to the project.
